# Building fully customised wordpress themes
I have been wanting to learn how to fully customise a wordpress website.

During this online course i will be updating my progress here to fall back on for reference. 

You can find the course I am enrolled in on Udemy at the link below:

Hopefully this can maybe help future learners too :)
